## Patterns of coding interview questions

<br />

In an effort to understand them more thoroughly myself, I will try to explain as best as I can the **patterns of coding interview questions**, as defined by [educative](https://educative.io). As far as I know the design gurus are the ones who came up with these. Educative in general I would highly recommend.

I will try to fill out the comments on these as much as possible, and explain them through youtube videos. If you want to get a fuller understanding please sign up for the course on their website.
